I’m a Principal Scientist in the PK Sciences <em>in vivo</em> ADME* group focusing on Study monitoring as well as Strategy and Innovation. My academic journey led me to earn a Bachelor’s and Master’s in Pharmaceutical Sciences from ETH Zurich, followed by a PhD in Pharmaceutical Sciences from the University of Basel.<br>

My professional path has been shaped by diverse experiences in the pharmaceutical and biotech industries. After completing my studies, I began my career at Philochem, where I helped implement proteomic analysis using data-independent acquisition. I then moved to Novartis as a Preclinical Formulation Scientist in the Global Drug Development division. Fueled by a passion for scientific exploration, I returned to academia in 2019 as a PhD candidate in the Biopharmacy Research Group with Prof. Meyer zu Schwabedissen. My research focused on the role of drug transporters in drug disposition, particularly Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptides (OATPs). During this time, I gained expertise in ADME through a variety of <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in vivo</em> assays, bioanalytics, and scientific project management.<br>

Outside of my research, I am deeply committed to personal development, social engagement, and teamwork. To further expand my professional capabilities, I’ve pursued certifications in Good Clinical Practice (GCP), project management, and various soft skills courses.<br>

In my free time, I’m always seeking new adventures, challenging my comfort zone, and embracing opportunities for lifelong learning.<br>
