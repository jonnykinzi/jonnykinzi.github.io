I am a dedicated Postdoctoral Researcher affiliated with the <a href='https://pharma.unibas.ch/en/research/research-groups/biopharmacy/'>Biopharmacy Research Group</a> at the University of Basel, Switzerland. Along my academic path, I have graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Pharmaceutical Sciences, a Masters of Science in Medicinal and Industrial Pharmaceutical Sciences from ETH Zurich, and a PhD in Pharmaceutical Sciences from the University of Basel.
<br>

My professional trajectory has been enriched by opportunities in the industrial pharmaceutical and biotech sectors. Following my academic pursuits, I delved into Philochem by contributing to the implementation of proteomic analysis using data-independent acquisition. Subsequently, I joined Global Drug Development division of Novartis in Basel. Here, I explored the stability of amorphous solid dispersions. Shortly after, I worked there as a formulation scientist to assess preclinical formulations of lead compounds for first <em>in vivo</em> studies.

Driven by passion for scientific exploration, I moved back to academia in 2019, joining the Biopharmacy Research Group as a PhD candidate with Prof. Meyer zu Schwabedissen. My doctoral research focused on elucidating the intricate influence of drug transporters on drug disposition, with a particular focus on Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide 2B1 (OATP2B1). Leveraging innovative rat models humanized and knocked-out for OATP2B1, I unraveled insights into its role in pharmacologicy and physiology. Throughout this journey, I achieved to develop skills and knowledge in ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion) and DMPK (Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics) as well as mastering a spectrum of <em>in vitro</em> assays and skills in <em>in vivo</em> studies.
<br>

Currently, in my Postdoctoral role, I am delving deeper into the role of coproporphyrins as biomarkers of hepatic OATPs. My involvement across diverse projects is contributed to my leading role in the development and validation of bioanalytical methods tailored for the quantification of small molecules and biomarkers.
<br>

Beyond academia and scientific endeavors, I am committed to personal growth and social competence. Embracing challenges outside my professional domain, I have pursued certifications in Good Clinical Practice (GCP), Project and Process Management, and a range of soft skills courses, enriching my professional skill set.
<br>

In my leisure time, I enjoy possibilities to explore adventures, continually pushing the boundaries of my comfort zone, and embracing lifelong learning.
