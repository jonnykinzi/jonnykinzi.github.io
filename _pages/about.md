I am a PhD candidate in the <a href='https://pharma.unibas.ch/en/research/research-groups/biopharmacy/'>Biopharmacy Research Group</a> under the supervision of Prof. Meyer zu Schwabedissen at the University of Basel, Switzerland. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Pharmaceutical Sciences and Masters of Science degree in Medicinal and Industrial Pharmaceutical Sciences from the ETH Zurich. During my journey I gained experience in the pharmaceutical and biotech industry. My passion about science brought me back to academia. In various roles, I developed a broad range of <em>in vitro</em> skills and also performed preclinical <em>in vivo</em> studies. Across different projects, I was additionally involved in the development and implementation of bioanalytical workflows for the quantification and/or identification of small molecules and biological samples.

In my free time, I like to challenge myself outside of my comfort zone. Currently, I educate myself about business management, consulting, coding, and investing, and by reading books and/or taking online courses.
