I am a dedicated Postdoctoral Researcher affiliated with the <a href='https://pharma.unibas.ch/en/research/research-groups/biopharmacy/'>Biopharmacy Research Group</a> at the University of Basel, Switzerland. at the University of Basel, Switzerland. With a robust educational background, I have earned a Bachelor of Science in Pharmaceutical Sciences, a Masters of Science in Medicinal and Industrial Pharmaceutical Sciences from ETH Zurich, and culminated my academic journey with a PhD in Pharmaceutical Sciences from the University of Basel.
<br>

My professional trajectory has been enriched by immersive experiences in both the pharmaceutical and biotech sectors. Following my academic pursuits, I delved into the practical realm by contributing to the implementation of data-independent acquisition of HLA-eluted peptides and the subsequent generation of spectral libraries. Subsequently, I joined Global Drug Development division of Novartis in Basel. Here, I explored the stability of amorphous solid dispersions. I continued to work as a formulation scientist to assessing formulations of lead compounds for first <em>in vivo</em> studies in preclinical setup.

Driven by an unwavering passion for scientific exploration, I transitioned back to academia in 2019, joining the Biopharmacy Research Group as a PhD candidate under the guidance of Prof. Meyer zu Schwabedissen. My doctoral research delved into elucidating the intricate influence of drug transporters on drug disposition, with a particular focus on Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide 2B1 (OATP2B1). Leveraging innovative rat models humanized and knocked-out for OATP2B1, I unraveled crucial insights into pharmacological and physiological mechanisms. Throughout this journey, I honed my expertise in ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion) and DMPK (Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics), conducting a spectrum of <em>in vitroo</em> assays and <em>in vivo</em> studies.
<br>

Currently, in my Postdoctoral role, I am delving deeper into the role of coproporphyrins as biomarkers of hepatic OATPs. My involvement across diverse projects has underscored my proficiency in the development, implementation, and validation of bioanalytical methods tailored for the quantification of small molecules and biomarkers.
<br>

Beyond the confines of academia and laboratory endeavors, I am committed to personal growth. Embracing challenges outside my professional domain, I have pursued certifications in Good Clinical Practice (GCP), Project and Process Management, and a range of soft skills courses, enriching my professional skill set.
<br>

In my leisure time, I relish the opportunity to explore new horizons, continually pushing the boundaries of my comfort zone, and embracing lifelong learning.
