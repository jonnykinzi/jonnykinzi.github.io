I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the <a href='https://pharma.unibas.ch/en/research/research-groups/biopharmacy/'>Biopharmacy Research Group</a> at the University of Basel, Switzerland. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Pharmaceutical Sciences, Masters of Science in Medicinal and Industrial Pharmaceutical Sciences from ETH Zurich, and a PhD in Pharmaceutical Sciences from the University of Basel. During my journey I gained experience in the pharmaceutical and biotech industry. I have worked on the implementation of data-independent acquisition of HLA-eluted peptides and the generation of spectral libraries. After my master studies, I joined Global Drug Development division of Novartis in Basel, where I investigated the stability of amorphous solid dispersions. There, I continued to work as a formulation scientist to assessing formulations of lead compounds for first <em>in vivo</em> studies in preclinical setup. My passion about science brought me back to academia. In 2019, I joined the Biopharmacy Research Group as a PhD candidate investigating the influence of drug transporters on drug disposition under the supervision of Prof. Meyer zu Schwabedissen. Particurarly, my researched focused on the role of the Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide 2B1 in pharmacology and physiology applying novel rat models that were humanized and knocked-out for OATP2B1. Over the years, I developed an expertise in ADME and DMPK conducting in <em>in vitro</em> assays and <em>in vivo</em> studies. Towards the end of my graduation and in my PostDoc, I investigate the role of coproporphyrins as biomarkers of hepatic OATPs. Across different projects, I was involved in the development, implementation, and validation of bioanalytical methods for the quantification of small molecules and biomarkers.

In my free time, I like to challenge myself outside of my comfort zone. Throughout my journeys, I attended in multiple courses obtaining certifications in GCP, Project and Process Management, and further soft skills.
