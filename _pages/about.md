I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the <a href='https://pharma.unibas.ch/en/research/research-groups/biopharmacy/'>Biopharmacy Research Group</a> at the University of Basel, Switzerland. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Pharmaceutical Sciences, Masters of Science degree in Medicinal and Industrial Pharmaceutical Sciences from the ETH Zurich, and a PhD in Pharmaceutical Sciences from the University of Basel. During my journey I gained experience in the pharmaceutical and biotech industry. I have worked on the implementation of data-independent acquisition of HLA-eluted peptides and the generation of spectral libraries. After my master studies, I joined Global Drug Development division of Novartis in Basel, where I investigated the stability of amorphous solid dispersions. There, I continued to work as a formulation scientist to assess preformulation and preclinical formulations of drug compounds for preclinical <em>in vivo</em> studies. My passion about science brought me back to academia. In 2019, I joined the Biopharmacy Research Group as a PhD candidate under the supervision of Prof. Meyer zu Schwabedissen investigating the role of the drug transporter Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide 2B1 in pharmacology and physiology applying a humanized and knockout rat models. Over the years, I developed a broad range of <em>in vitro</em> skills and also performed preclinical <em>in vivo</em> studies. Across different projects, I was involved in the development, implementation, and validation of bioanalytical methods for the quantification and identification of small molecules and biomarkers in biological samples.

In my free time, I like to challenge myself outside of my comfort zone. Currently, I educate myself on business management, consulting, coding, and financial literacy.
